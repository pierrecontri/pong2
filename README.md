PONG2 (based on Arcanoid)
=========================

Presentation
------------
This development is about a little game based on Arcanoid (1974).


History
-------
I develop this game in 2005 in javascript, before the jQuery incoming.
I used the procedural programming.
I transform it in object programming in 2006. Many people said me that is a stupid idea.

At now, 13 years later, I always use the code in example for my job. Many companies are so late in this technology.

It was compatible Netscape 4 until 2017.

Orientation
-----------
On 2017, new orientation technologie.
Go Ahead is the new orientation.
The pong is now in JavaScript ECMAScript v6 "use strict" standard. Don't mind about Navigator wich does not respect standards (like Google, IE11, Edge, ... ). There are norms : use it !

About Free Criticizing
----------------------
Fuck developers who says "Chrome is the standard" and criticize proper development but does not develop themselves.
