PONG2 (based on Arcanoid)
=========================

Presentation
------------
This development is about a little game based on Arcanoid (1974).

History
-------
I develop it in 2006 in javascript, before the jQuery incoming.
It was compatible Netscape 4 until 2017.

Orientation
-----------
On 2017, new orientation technologie.
Go Ahead is the new orientation.
The pong is now in JavaScript ECMA6 "use strict" standard. Don't mind about Navigator wich does not respect standards (like Google, IE11, Edge, ... ). There are norms : use it !

About Free Criticizing
----------------------
Fuck developers who says "Chrome is the standard" and criticize proper development but does not develop themselves.
